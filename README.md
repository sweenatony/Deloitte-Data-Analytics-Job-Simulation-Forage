# Deloitte-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Work-Experience( Job Simulation)

Project Overview

This project uses Tableau to analyze and visualize machine downtime data from Daikiboâ€™s four global manufacturing plants. By integrating telemetry data, we identified operational inefficiencies and supported informed decision-making around preventive maintenance.

Task 1 - Data Analysis

ðŸš€ Key Features
Telemetry Data Integration: Consolidated JSON data from Daikibo factories in:

Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)

Seiko (Osaka, Japan)

Berlin (Germany)

Shenzhen (China)

Downtime Metrics: Created a custom-calculated field assigning 10 minutes of downtime for each machine reporting an â€˜Unhealthyâ€™ status.

Visual Analytics: Designed insightful bar charts to illustrate:

Downtime by Factory

Downtime by Device Type

Interactive Dashboard: Built a dynamic dashboard with filtering options, enabling users to explore data and pinpoint the root causes of operational delays.

Insightful Findings: Pinpointed the factory with the highest total downtime, helping prioritize process improvement efforts.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

Tableau (Desktop/Public): Used for building all visualizations and dashboards.

JSON: Format of the imported telemetry data files.

ðŸ§° How to Use

Install Tableau: Download Tableau Public or Desktop

Import Data: Load the provided JSON files into Tableau

Explore: Use the calculated fields and dashboard to analyze factory performance

âš–Task 2 â€“ Forensic Technology

ðŸ“Œ Gender Pay Equality Analysis at Daikibo Industrials

To investigate concerns around gender-based salary gaps, we developed a framework to measure and classify pay equality across job roles using an Equality Score ranging from -100 to +100.

âœ… Implementation Steps

Score Classification: Introduced a new column in the dataset to categorize scores as:

Fair (Â±10) â€“ Equal pay

Unfair (-10 to -20 / 10 to 20) â€“ Moderate disparity

Highly Discriminative (< -20 or > 20) â€“ Major inequality


ðŸ›  Tools Used

Microsoft Excel: For data processing, applying classification formulas, and presenting results with conditional formatting and charts.

ðŸ“ˆ Impact

Rapid Identification: Easily spotted problem areas with significant pay gaps

Informed Decision-Making: Highlighted job roles and locations needing corrective action

Meaningful Change: Contributed to a company-wide push for fair and transparent compensation practices
